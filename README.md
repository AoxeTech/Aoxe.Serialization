# Zaabee.Serializers

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Zaabee/Zaabee/_apis/build/status/Mutuduxf.Zaabee.Serializers?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/Zaabee/Zaabee/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

The wraps and extensions for serializers.

## [Zaabee.Binary](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.Binary)

Base by System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter,the first party BinaryFormatter from microsoft.

## [Zaabee.Jil](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.Jil)

A fast JSON (de)serializer, built on [Sigil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Sigil) with a number of somewhat crazy optimization tricks.

## [Zaabee.NewtonsoftJson](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.NewtonsoftJson)

Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET [https://www.newtonsoft.com/json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)

## [Zaabee.MsgPack](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.MsgPack)

MessagePack is an extremely efficient object serialization library. It's like JSON, but very fast and small.

## [Zaabee.Utf8Json](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.Utf8Json)

Definitely Fastest and Zero Allocation JSON Serializer for C#(NET, .NET Core, Unity, Xamarin).

## [Zaabee.Protobuf](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.Protobuf)

protobuf-net is a contract based serializer for .NET code, that happens to write data in the "protocol buffers" serialization format engineered by Google. The API, however, is very different to Google's, and follows typical .NET patterns (it is broadly comparable, in usage, to XmlSerializer, DataContractSerializer, etc). It should work for most .NET languages that write standard types and can use attributes.

## [Zaabee.SystemTextJson](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.SystemTextJson)

The System.Text.Json namespace provides high-performance, low-allocating, and standards-compliant capabilities to process JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which includes serializing objects to JSON text and deserializing JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in. It also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-8, and to create an in-memory document object model (DOM) for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data.

## [Zaabee.Xml](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.Xml)

Serializes and deserializes objects into and from XML documents. The XmlSerializer enables you to control how objects are encoded into XML.

## [Zaabee.ZeroFormatter](https://github.com/Mutuduxf/Zaabee.Serializers/tree/master/src/Zaabee.ZeroFormatter)

Fastest C# Serializer and Infinitely Fast Deserializer for .NET, .NET Core and Unity.
